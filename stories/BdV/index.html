    <h1 class="header">GRLC meets Triply's Data Stories</h1>
    <p>Once upon a time  there were SPARQL queries. Brilliant to retrieve data with, horrible to share over the web.
    Basil eased this bitter taste somewhat, but it was only GRLC that allowed SPARQL queries to taste like API's.
    Online executable queries, awesome... complete with tags, and a summary and provenance...
    But great food is not just about taste... it's also about presentation....
    </p>
    <p>
    Enter Data Stories.. and as it so happens... perfectly compatible with GRLC.
    For example, the query below actually resides <a href="https://github.com/CLARIAH/BdVteaching-queries/blob/master/loman-adamlink-neighbourhoods.rq">here</a>, stored with GRLC tags and all.
    And while you have all the benefits of <a href="http://grlc.io/api/CLARIAH/BdVteaching-queries">running the query in GRLC</a>, you get all the beauty of data stories's viz and text as you can see below (yes, that's right: sparql query output on a map!).
    </p>
    <div data-query data-query-output="leaflet" data-query-sparql="loman-adamlink-neighbourhoods.rq"></div>
    <p>
    It would be cool if you could directly visualize the query from a grlc repo:
    <div data-query data-query-output="leaflet" data-query-sparql="loman-adamlink-bdv.rq"></div>
